Version 1.3.1 - 1999/08/08
--------------------------
* Incorporated George Yohng's changes to build under Windows with
  Borland C++ or Visual C++


Version 1.3.0 - 1998/11/26
--------------------------
* Some small, but glaring, bug fixes


Version 1.2.1 - 1996/02/26
--------------------------
* ???


Version 1.2 - 1995/10/17
------------------------
* Added configure script for easy setup (including automatically
  putting the HP-UX compiler in ANSI mode!)
* Added documentation.
* Cleaned up and fixed a few things so that (hopefully) all available
  dithering modes are supported.  Note that a number of ditherings 
  result in obviously wrong images, but they look the same as what
  the original mpeg_play gave, so it's not my fault.  However, the 
  ones that do work (ordered, gray, 2x2 have been verified) generally 
  result in significant memory savings and faster decoding when compared
  to full 24-bit colour.
* Added PictureRate and BitRate fields to ImageDesc.


Version 1.1 - 1994/11/14
------------------------
* Added preprocessor directory FULL_COLOR_ONLY to make inclusion of
  all dithering code (except 24-bit full colour) optional.
* Cleaned up the ANSI/non-ANSI confusion, and made it explicit in the
  README that you need an ANSI compiler to build the library itself
  but not to merely use it.


Version 1.0.1 - 1994/09/13
--------------------------
* Some changes to the headers and Makefile for portability and
  compatiblity (particularly with ImageMagick).


Version 1.0 - 1994/07/29
------------------------
Initial release
