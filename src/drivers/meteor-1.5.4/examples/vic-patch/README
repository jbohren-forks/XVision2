This is a patch for using meteor-1.4a with vic-2.8.

Installation:

1. Copy the patch in the directory where vic's code is extracted.

2. patch -p < meteor.patch

3. Copy ioctl_meteor.h in the same directory.

4. Do configure.

5. Edit Makefile to incorporate the meteor driver. 

   OBJ_GRABBER =  grabber-meteor.o

6. make vic.dyn

Note that grabber-meteor.cc uses /dev/meteor[0,1]. Make sure that the
device nodes exist.

Enjoy!!
