vu4-color is an adaptation of vu4 for live feed over the network. 
vu4-color has been compiled under Linux 1.3.85. should have no problems running it 
straight off. 

the code is not at all cleaned up. it allocates colors to the most
frequently occuring colors in the image sampled every NSAMPLESECS = 5 seconds. 
to get different sizes change MAXROWS and MAXCOLS in colorDisplay.h 
For a thin wire ethernet network, we can do 160x120 24 bit RGB @ 30 Hz. 
200x200 is almost as good. 

sent any bugs, comments to mahamud@cs.cmu.edu
