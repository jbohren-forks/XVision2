             Description and Operating Instruction for the
		   Meteor-Frame-Grabber-Card-Widget
		        Version 0.8.1 for Tcl/Tk


This is a beta tested version of a Tcl/Tk Widget with the following features:

This copy was modified by Mark Sutton <mark.sutton@laitram.com> to compile
on glibc2 (aka. libc6) based versions of Linux.  

Thanks to Guilherme Nelson DeSouza <gnelson@ecn.purdue.edu> for patches
to the Makefile.

It also trys to link against tk8.0 and tcl8.0.  If you have an earlier 
version of tk and tcl, you must modify the Makefile accordingly.
This should work with tcl7.5 and tk4.1 or later.

All the filenames still come out 0.8 for now...

Features:
*********

	- 24 bit and 15 bit colour and 8 bit grayscale life video on screen
	  (depending on hardware resources)
	- video on hold
	- 24 bit and 15 bit colour and 8 bit grayscale single picture
	  grabbing to disk as ppm/pgm file
	- the following parameters are adjustable by the user:
	  * format, device, yuv-format
	  * relief, border, background
	  * contrast, brightness, chroma, hue, chcv, frames per second
	  * source for grabbing single pictures (meteor-card or screen)


The program has typical Tcl/Tk command syntax structure

Command structure:
******************

fgrab <name>:  creates a fgrab widget with name <name>
	       possible command line arguments are the same as in
	       "<name> configure" and in addition -format (pal, secam, ntsc),
	       -device (svideo, dev0, dev1, dev2, rca, rgb <- I don't know if
	       rgb works, please tell me) and -yuv (planar, packed <- Natoma
	       and similar boards). The last three options cannot be changed
	       after creating the widget. 

<name> video ?arg?:	possible arguments are on, hold, off

<name> configure ?arg value?:  possible arguments are any combination
			of -relief, -border and -background. They have
			similar meaning as in other widgets.

<name> videoconfigure ?arg value?:  possible arguments are any
			combination  of -rows, -columns, -contrast,
			-bright, -chroma, -hue, -chcv,  -fps. With
			these arguments you can adjust the parameters
			for live video directly on the Meteor-card.

<name> captureconfigure ?arg value?:  possible arguments are any
			combination of -rows, -columns, -contrast,
			-bright, -chroma, -hue, -chcv, -oformat,
			-source. With these arguments you can adjust
			the paramaters for grabbing single pictures
			independently from the video parameters.
			With -oformat you can adjust the colordepth in
			which the actuall image is grabbed (24/15/8
			bit). With "-source video/meteor" you can
			specify either to grab from the meteor-card or
			directly from the screen (if the latter is
			choosed the colordepth is determined from the
			life video) 
				
<name> capture <filename>:  This command captures a single picture with
			24/15/8 bit from the Meteor card and saves it on
			disk as a ppm/pgm file with the name <filename>.   

<name> fpscount ?arg?:  possible parameters are on, off. This command
			is displaying the actual framegrabbing rate of
			the widget. This might be not the same as
			configured with the -fps option. It depends on
			the hardware you use (Pentium 133, 32 MB,
			Intel VX-Board, Matrox Millenium 4 MB: max 13
			fps). You should use this option carefully!!!
			to determine the highest framegrabbing rate
			the widget is able to run at. I used the alarm
			signal handler exclusively for this
			purpose. So other applications or the same
			Tcl/Tk-programm  can run into conflicts if
			they use it by themself.


Compiling and running the program:
**********************************

I wrote and compiled the program with linux-2.0.25 and
tcl7.5/tk4.1. If you run newer versions of tcl/tk (7.6/4.2) there
should be no problems. Just change the names of the libraries in the
Makefile accordingly. Attention: It will not run with older ones
(7.4/4.0)! 

In the Makefile you can specify your device and your format you are
working with. Users with Natoma-Boards should specify this by using
the option BOARD = NATOMA. In doing this you specify your default
settings but you can override them using the command line options of
the widget.

Making the program creates a fgrab_wish-0.8 with which you can work in
the same fashion as with wish, wishx, ...

In this version there is still a lot of output to the standard-error
channel to make debugging easier. If you don´t like that start
your program with 2>/dev/null.


Sample Program:
***************

Together with the source code you got a sample Tcl-program fgrab-0.4.tcl. Just
run it to see how the fgrab-widget works. 
If you want to capture single images you have to start the life video before!

Short description of the buttons:
 
24bpp,15bpp,b/w:	chooses the colordepth of single grabbed images
direct/video-capture:	chooses the source (meteorcard or screen) to
			grab single images from
increment:		if choosen adds an automatical increasing
			number to the name of the file (the button
			beneath it resets the number) 
correlate:		if choosen the scales of the single
			capture options were automatically adjusted to
			the values of the life-video scales
load image:		if choosen the the grabbed and saved image
			will be	displayed on screen
continous:		if choosen you can grab images
			continously. Amount and intervall have to be
			specified.
fast grabbing:		if choosen the images will be grabbed as fast
			as possible
planar/packed:		chooses the yuv-mode for 8 bit single picture
			grabbing or life-video (important for
			Natoma-Boards) 

The other buttons should be self explaining



KNOWN BUGS:
***********

- if you stop the programm with CTRL^C the System resoures are not
  beeing released
- when the program hangs or has internal errors (TCL_ERROR) system
  resoures are not beeing released

-> if you do these things more often you will probably run in an out of
memory error. Just reboot you mashine :-) (I am working on it!)


Future Work:
************

- removing bugs!!!
- changing the result the widget-commands return for smart use 




I would be grateful for feedback and bug report to me

Have fun
