Preamble

This driver represents a collective effort of many developers. Hopefully,
most of them are credited within this document.

This driver is under active development. While many are using it with
success in fairly rigorous environments, it should be considered beta
quality. Adjust your expectations accordingly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recent Modification History:

6 April 1999 Release of 1.5.4:

   * Added auto-configuration capabilities so the driver can autoconfigure
     itself for any 2.0.x or 2.2.x kernel. Probably works for most 2.1.x
     also.
   * Fixed a bug that reportedly caused the even field from one frame to be
     pared with the odd field from the subsequent frame. There was some
     debate as to whether this actually was happening (it's awfully hard to
     experimentally determine, the timing between the fields is identical),
     and whether it actually means something, but in any case, I think it's
     fixed.
   * Fixed a long-standing bug in the auto detection of field rate that was
     causing every 6th frame to be dropped in PAL and SECAM mode. (Hey, what
     can I say, I'm in an NTSC country! :-)
   * Thanks to the following for contributing patches that assisted in the
     development of this release.
        o Ove Ewerlid <Ove.Ewerlid@syscon.uu.se>.
        o Tony Hague <tony.hague@bbsrc.ac.uk>
        o Mark Wolski <mwolski@gmr.com>
        o Conrad Sanderson <conrad@hive.me.gu.edu.au>
     Thanks to all!

22 January 1999 Release of 1.5.3:

   * Placed into the package the files meteor-2.2.0-pre8.c and
     meteor-2.2.0-pre8.h. To compile and use under 2.2.x kernels, replace
     the meteor.h and meteor.c source files with these.
   * The above sources were contributed by Ove Ewerlid
     <Ove.Ewerlid@syscon.uu.se>. Many Thanks!

23 September 1998 Release of 1.5.2:

   * Incorporated patch submitted by Chris Eveland (see 31 August entry,
     below).
   * Updated documentation and program comments. This mostly entailed
     updating email contact information for the various contributors. This
     readme file was also fairly extensively re-organized.
   * Added discussion on which meteor to use for which chipset to this
     document. Mark Sutton mark.sutton@laitram.com

31 August 1998:

   * Updated for kernel version 2.1.117 by Chris Eveland
     (eveland@cs.rochester.edu). So far this has only been tested on the SMP
     version of 2.1.117 and the UP version of 2.0.34. The read call has not
     been tested, just mmap and some ioctls.

     Note: See some special instructions regarding kernel 2.1.117 (and
     development series kernel's close to it) in the section "Which
     bigphysarea patch do I use?", below.

28 July 1998

   * fgrab now working on glibc based distributions of Linux.

27 July 1998

   * Made the famous "sys/ioctl.h" to "linux/ioctl.h" in ioctl_meteor.h.
     (This gets the driver itself working and *is* backward compatible to
     older systems.) (This modification alone gets "snap-0.5", "single", and
     "several" working.)
   * Modified "mvid". Our modified version compiles and runs on libc-6 and
     libc-5 systems.
   * Modified "vu" and "vu4-color". These we have tested for ability to
     compile only, we have not run them. (Subsequent tests have confirmed
     them to indeed run on libc6 and libc5 distributions - ms.)

General Historical Background

This work was supported by RWI (Real World Interface) Inc., and the AI Lab
at Brown University.

This is a port and partial rewrite of the FreeBSD Matrox Meteor FrameGrabber
Driver, written by Jim Lowe and Mark Tinguely. Matt Welsh's bigphysarea
mechanism is used to substitute for the BSD vm_page_alloc_contig().

It requires at least a 1.3-series kernel, but it hasn't been tested on such
an ancient kernel in ages, you should really upgrade to something newer then
this for a number of reasons! It also works with v2.x.x series kernels. The
bigphysarea patch is not included in the v2.x.x kernel so you still need to
make the patch. See the section "Which bigphysarea patch do I use?" below
for information on which patch to use for your kernel.

Older and possibly newer versions can be found on ftp.rwii.com in
/pub/linux/system/Meteor, which is the driver's home site.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Older History:

Version 1.0: 5/1/96

   * Made checkPCI() inline, #ifdeffed it on DEBUG_METEOR so it should
     disappear unless debugging is set.
   * Changed Makefile to compile -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes. This revealed a
     typo in ioctl METEORSBT254. Fixed. Added parens, prototypes etc until
     no warnings.
   * Renamed vw to vu.

Version 1.1: 5/6/96

   * Implemented METEORSTATUS ioctl fix posted by Jim Lowe.

Version 1.2: 14/May/96 Ian Reid (ian@robots.ox.ac.uk)

   * Fixed frames per second so that it actually implements the call in the
     saa7116.
   * Fixed bug in SVIDEO input which ignored chrominance by just reverting
     to the bsd bit of this code.
   * Fixed #define METEOR_INPUT_DEV_RCA
   * Fixed #define METEOR_DEV_MASK
   * Fixed spelling of PLANAR
   * Added a selectable system default (SYSTEM=PAL/SECAM/NTSC)

Version 1.3 22/May/96 Ian Reid (ian@robots.ox.ac.uk)

   * Fixed problem with PAL RGB mode (from jonas@mcs.com)
   * Fixed problem with frames per second code
   * Fixed problem with PCF8574_xxxx_WRITE
   * Added METEOR_GEO_ODD_EVEN to enable separate capture of odd/even fields
   * Added METEOR_SIG_[FRAME|FIELD] to toggle between interrupts after each
     field or frame (frame still the default)
   * Added METEOR_FIELD_MODE to capture fields as if they were frames ***
     this has not been thoroughly tested on all image types and on
     synchronous capture ***

Version 1.4 17/July/96 ian@robots.ox.ac.uk & anuj@fwi.uva.nl

   * Fixed prob inadvertently introduced to set_fps in the last fix (thanks
     Pedro Felzenszwalb pff@cs.cornell.edu)
   * Tested and fixed FIELD_MODE stuff
   * Added support for YUV in synchronous mode
   * Allow lowat==hiwat==0 in synchronous mode to mean capture in
     round-robin fashion without user intervention. Also added cur_frame to
     struct meteor_mem so that this info is available in shared memory.
   * It appears that not only is there a problem with the number of bits in
     the dma_end registers (only 22), but that the dma regs themselves don't
     increment over 4Mb boundaries. Instead they wrap around to the start of
     the 4Mb block. Furthermore, since they only increment in 4 byte words,
     if the image width is not divisible by 8 then YUV images can overflow
     (since the U and V parts are saved separately using dma regs 1 and 2).
     The changes to fix these problems are due to anuj@fwi.uva.nl and
     include a complete rewrite of alloc_frame_buffer which may not be
     completely backwardly compatibile, but is much cleaner and more
     general. You can now grab a sequence of images once (using a new
     capture flag METEOR_CAP_CONT_ONCE added by anuj@fwi.uva.nl) and use
     buffers of >4Mb. In order to allow this, a new ioctl (METEORGFROFF)
     returns the offsets into the frame buffer of each frame and the
     meteor_mem structure (see ioctl_meteor.h for the meteor_frame_offset
     structure).

Version 1.4a 23/7/96

   * Very minor changes to tidy v1.4 and update some info in README
   * Bug fixes from Mark Wolski (mwolski@rvssun3.gmr.com)
   * Fix to FIELD_MODE so it resets properly

Version 1.4b 5/11/96

   * Minor bug fixes
   * Added equivalence between YUV_422 and YUV_PLANAR
   * Changed name of vu4 to mvid, cleaned it up the command line interface
     and wrote a man page.

Version 1.4c 20/2/97

   * Bug fixes (from burschka@mail.lpr.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de)

Which Model Of Meteor Board Do I Need For Which Processor/Chipset?

(Read This Section!!!!!! It Is Important!!)

There has been tremendous confusion in the meteor user's mailing list lately
regarding which meteor to use with which processor and/or chipset.

I make an attempt here to clear up the muddiness somewhat.

Point # 1:
This Linux driver supports the Meteor, Meteor/RGB, Meteor/PPB, and
Meteor/RGB/PPB boards. IT DOES NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORT the Meteor-II. All
discussion below refers to the first four boards mentioned above, NOT the
Meteor-II.

All the above mentioned products are currently in production and, according
to Matrox, will be for several more years.

Point # 2:
Matrox makes four (4) variations of the original Meteor. The Meteor,
Meteor/RGB, Meteor/PPB, and Meteor/RGB/PPB.

The "RGB" boards have the ability to grab images from an RGB type camera.

Now comes the interesting part:

The "PPB" boards were introduced to address compatibility problems with
early Pentium PRO motherboards.

This is a hardware issue, not a driver issue. Some, and I stress SOME,
Pentium Pro, and Pentium-II mother board implementations require a PPB board
to work correctly, others REQUIRE one of the non-PPB designated boards, e.g.
a Meteor, or Meteor/RGB (without the PPB designation).

This is a HARDWARE issue. What I am about to say here holds true for DOS,
Windows/95/98/NT, as well as for Linux (and BSD, etc.)

Unfortunately, there have been exceptions reported to almost all of the
combinations outlined, but basically:

   486 PCI implementations                 Forget it, won't work.

   "Orion" chipset.                        Forget it, won't work.

   Pentium 430** chipsets (Triton Series)  Meteor (non-PPB)

   PPro/P-II 440FX                         Meteor/PPB

             440LX                         Problematic,
                                           Some require Meteor/PPB,
                                           some require Meteor,
                                           some work with both,
                                           some work with neither.
                                           (no bull)
                                           (BTW, we have an LX
                                           ABIT brand motherboard
                                           that works perfectly in all
                                           modes - yes including
                                           YUV_PLANER - with our
                                           non-PPB meteors, but my
                                           mail files have been innundated
                                           with horror stories about
                                           this chipset and meteors.
                                           AVOID!)

           440EX                           Meteor (non-PPB)

           440BX                           Meteor (non-PPB)

Non-Intel Pentium chipsets:                YMMV.  I have seen positive
                                           success reports with SiS
                                           chipsets.

Bottom Line:

With the Triton series and a non-PPB, you're golden.

With the 440FX and the PPB, you're ok.

440EX or 440BX with non-PPB is good.

AVOID THE 440LX!!!!!

I need some reports regarding chipsets newer than 440BX.

If you have a 440LX based system that you just must use a Meteor with, see
if your distributor will sell you one of each and let you return the one
that doesn't work. (Or return both if neither do...).

Finally:

Most Matrox distributors are telling people: "Use a non-PPB with a Pentium,
and a PPB with a PPro or P-II". THIS IS BAD INFORMATION!!!!! GO BY THE TABLE
ABOVE!

This is true for Windows/95/98/NT as well as Linux!

(Rant mode off... I apologize!)

BTW: The file "http://www.matrox.com/imgweb/products/meteor/meteor.pdf"
contains a compatibility table by PC model, that tells you which Meteor
version you need for specific PC's. The good news is that it helps sort out,
to some extent, which 440LX systems use the PPB, and which use the non-PPB.
The bad news is that the list is far from all-inclusive of all available
computers! (The list jibes with the table above, to the extent of the
computer models it covers...)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installing:

  1. If you are running SMP, you must uncomment the two SMP lines near the
     top of the Makefile.
  2. Change the SYSTEM variable near the top of the Makefile to whatever you
     want your default system to be.
  3. Make sure you have kernel 1.3.72 or newer. Preferably, 2.0.32 or newer.
     This driver will absolutely not work on anything older than 1.3.72 and
     the current maintainer does not have ready access to kernels earlier
     than the 2.0.X series so nothing earlier than 2.0.X is officially
     supported anymore (although they might work).
  4. If you don't already have bigphysarea in your kernel, do patch -p1
     <bigphysarea-patch in the kernel root directory, usually
     /usr/src/linux. See the next section to help you determine which
     bigphysarea patch is the one you need. Run "make config", "make
     menuconfig", or (my favorite) "make xconfig" in the kernel root
     directory. Select the Reserve Big Physical Memory item in the General
     Setup Menu. Remake your kernel.

     Note: the newest bigphysarea patch for the 2.2.5 kernel (which works on
     several other 2.2.x series kernels, see below) does not add this
     selection to the "make *config" process. With this patch, bigphysarea
     reservation will be turned on all the times in a kernel patched with
     this patch.
  5. You will need to add stuff like this to your /etc/lilo.conf:

     image=/vmlinuz
             label=linux-big
             append="bigphysarea=XXX"
             root=/dev/hda2
             read-only

     XXX = number of 4k-pages. For example, to grab one image 640x480x32bpp
     use 301. If you get ENOMEMs, increase the XXX value.
  6. If you want to use kerneld, add this to /etc/conf.modules:

     alias char-major-40 meteor

     If you are not using kerneld, (the neat autoloading thing), it probably
     isn't necessary.
  7. Do mknod {0,1} c 40 {0,1} to produce

     crw-r--r--   1 root     root      40,   0 Mar 14 22:19 /dev/mmetfgrab0
     crw-r--r--   1 root     root      40,   0 Mar 14 22:19 /dev/meteor0

     crw-r--r--   1 root     root      40,   1 Mar 14 22:19 /dev/mmetfgrab1
     crw-r--r--   1 root     root      40,   1 Mar 14 22:19 /dev/meteor1

     or whatever you prefer. The test programs will look for the mmetfgrab
     names.
  8. If you have just upgraded your kernel, you need to delete the file
     "kernelversioninfo.h" in the "meteor-1.5.4" directory and then re-make
     the driver. This will cause the makefile to reconfigure for your new
     kernel version.
  9. Do make and make install in the source directory. You need to SU for
     the make install. The make install will do depmod -a for you. Just cut
     this line out if you will be using insmod/rmmod. Do this make while
     running the kernel image you intend to use the driver with.

     The RedHat module directories are not compatible with this makefiles'
     "make install" so enough lines have been commented out in this
     pre-release that "make install" will probably not do anything useful.
     We just put meteor.o somewhere convenient and use insmod/rmmod. (Mark
     Sutton - mark.sutton@laitram.com). Fixing the makefile is probably not
     very hard though, maybe in the next pre-release...

     Your meteors can all use the same IRQ, and are set up for IRQ sharing
     with other devices. Note that the other devices are more than likely
     not, but if you can load the module, it means everything should be OK
     regarding IRQ allocation/sharing.
 10. You will need to be running kerneld or manually insmod the module.
 11. If you have problems, uncomment the DEBUG_METEOR and SHOW_CAPT_ERRORS
     lines in meteor.h and remake, etc to see a lot of chatter about what is
     going on.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which bigphysarea patch do I use?:

Patches for a number of 2.0.XX series stable kernels are available from:
http://www.uni-paderborn.de/fachbereich/AG/heiss/linux/bigphysarea.html.
Simply pick the one for your kernel. Most, if not all, of these patches can
also be found at ftp://rwii.com/pub/linux/system/Meteor

At the above two sites, you will find a patch for kernel 2.2.5 also. I have
found this patch to work for 2.2.2 - 2.2.5 inclusive.

The above patch may work for 2.2.0 and 2.2.1 also. If not, you can try
"2.2.0-pre8.bigphys.patch" at the ftp.rwii.com site. Note that this "pre8"
patch has a bug that disables SMP functions in SMP machines, yikes! Best to
stick with the stable "2.2.5" patch and update your kernel if you have to.
