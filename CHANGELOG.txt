new parameter added to XVDig1394 to reset the ieee1394 bus - i1
see XVDig1394.h
  Often, the system does not allow to restart the iso-transmission due
  to wrong termination of the previous program. This option initiates a
  reset on the bus.... use with caution, because it resets all devices
  on the current IEEE1394 connection
